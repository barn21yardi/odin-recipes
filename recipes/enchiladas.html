                    Finding food might not seem easy for a three-toed sloth; the animals are notoriously handicapped when it comes to both seeing and hearing the world around them. What's more, because the sloth spends the majority of its day sleeping, it feeds at night, making its poor sense of sight almost entirely useless. Still, three-toed sloths manage to forage for and consume a handful of different foods, including leaves, fruits and shoots. They likely accomplish this solely through the use of smell and touch.
