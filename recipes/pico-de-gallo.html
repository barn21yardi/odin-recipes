        <em>Learn how to make Pico de Gallo with this quick and easy recipe! It only takes about 10 minutes, calls for 7 simple ingredients, and tastes perfectly fresh and delicious every time.</em>
        <p>A few weeks ago on Instagram, I shared my list of Mexican recipes that I was planning to make this year for Cinco De Mayo, and asked if you all had any additional requests. And amongst the hundreds of messages I received (which made my day, so happy to be in the company of Insta friends who love Mexican food as much as I do!), I noticed that there were three words that came up again and again…and again and again and again. Yes.</p>

        <p>Pico de gallo.</p>

        <p>Ha, guys, I had no idea how much you all love your pico! Also, I had no idea that this classic of all classic recipes was somehow missing here on the blog. Bah, this absolutely will not do for the blogger whose all-time favorite two foods are chips and salsa (<– with pico de gallo, of course, to thank as the original salsa that started it all). I’d say it’s high time to remedy this.</p>
        
        <p>So for those of you looking for a stellar pico de gallo recipe to whip up for Cinco de Mayo this year — and hopefully, if you’re like us, as often as possible the rest of the year — here’s my favorite.</p>
