    <h2>What is elote?</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Elote is classic Mexican street corn, grilled and slathered in an irresistible sauce. Built-in handles make for easy eating!</em>
        <
        <p>Elote is grilled corn that’s slathered in a sauce of sour cream, mayonnaise, and chili powder, and sprinkled with cheese. It’s a popular snack served by street vendors in Mexico, so it’s often called Mexican street corn. Of course, it’s the very best on the street in Mexico or cities that have a strong Mexican heritage: there’s nothing like it!</p>

        <p>What makes elote so irresistible is the contrasts of flavors and textures. You’ve got the sweet corn, charred to smoky perfection on the grill, then the creamy mayo and sour cream sauce. Our sauce has chili powder, garlic powder and cumin, then it’s filled with chunks of feta, cotija, or queso fresco cheese. Serve it with tangy lime and cilantro, and the crunch of the corn against the creamy, messy sauce is satisfying in almost a primal way.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-Heat.</strong><p>Heat a grill to medium high.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Shuck.</strong><p>Shuck the corn by peeling down the outside layers one at a time and keeping them attached, facing downwards away from the cob. When you’ve finished, use kitchen twine or string to tie the leaves together.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Oil Cobs.</strong><p>Use your hands to rub oil on each corn cob evenly, then place them on a baking sheet.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Combine Ingredients</strong><p>In a small bowl, mix the sour cream, mayonnaise, feta or queso fresco (crumbling any large chunks into smaller chunks with your fingers), chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and kosher salt in small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Grill.</strong><p>Place the corn on the grill and cook until it begins to blacken, then turn. Cook about 12 to 15 minutes total, until blackened on all sides.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Serve.</strong><p>Place the corn back on the baking sheet and use a spoon to coat it with cheese mixture. Garnish with a squeeze of lime and torn cilantro leaves. Serve immediately, using the tied husks as a handle for easy eating.</p></li>
